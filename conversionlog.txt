Status: NOT COMPILIBLE
--------------------------------------------------------------
== 05/22/2013 ==
Uleat: Cleaned up InventoryLimits and added a few additional accessors
Uleat: Added InvalidateSlotStruct(). Used to set inital/reset struct invalidation
Uleat: Added Server, Mob, and Client valid slot struct checks
Uleat: Added IsDeleteRequest()
Uleat: Added Client-level inline valid slot struct checks for client and server

== 05/16/2013 ==
Uleat: Created branch 'inventory_conversion' based on Revision 312100e (commit 265)
Uleat: Added 'InventorySlot_Struct'
Uleat: Added new InvWhereLocation bitmask enumeration. Will be adjusted as necessary
Uleat: Initiated a Managed Cursor class..still in development
Uleat: Initiated an Inventory Limits class..still in development
Uleat: Remodeled Inventory storage maps to include all known client slot types. A lot will be removed after initial testing
Uleat: Added new InventorySlotTypes enumeration
Uleat: Added new InventoryPossessions enumeration. Replaces the old InventorySlot enumeration..but not depricated as yet
Uleat: Added some inventory limit definitions..will be refined as developed (needs client research to determine values)

NOTE: InventoryLimits is presented as designed..features can be added as/if needed. The #defines for client assignment still need
      some work, as well as the per-client conditional checks. I will show examples in the code as I alter and adapt functions.
	  If there's an issue with using the initializers as static, I'll change them back to instanced -U
